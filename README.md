# Log Reminder

It reminds the team members to push their work logs at the start of every month and if the still didn't push we remind them again everyday.

## Requirements
* Local Mail Transfer Agent (I setup mine using [this guide](https://opensource.com/article/18/8/postfix-open-source-mail-transfer-agent))
* Docker (if you want to run rabbitmq using docker)
